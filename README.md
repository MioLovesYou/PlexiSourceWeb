Plexi Source
=================
A small project. Allows you to share, rate, and use source code. Will be API / Website uploads.


What I need to do.
------------

On the front-end,
- Finish off submissions design. It looks *terrible* at the moment.
- Finish off the index page.
- Make 404 page. 

On the back-end,
- Allow access to a source code by using the id.
- Get the API side of things done.
